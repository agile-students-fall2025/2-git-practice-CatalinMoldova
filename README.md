# Vision Language Models Blog

I found this informative blog post on Vision Language Models by Hugging Face:  
[Vision Language Models Explained](https://huggingface.co/blog/vlms)

This article provides a great introduction to the internals of vision language models, explains a variety of existing models, and offers guidance on fine-tuning them. It covers how these models combine image and text understanding to perform tasks like image captioning, visual question answering, and object detection.

What captivates me about this article is how it highlights the rapid evolution of multimodal AI models and their diverse applications in both research and industry. The technical depth combined with practical examples makes it a valuable resource for understanding the future of AI that bridges vision and language.
